# Feature Specification: Interface Unification

**Feature Branch**: `001-interface-unification`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Current interface conflicts in lua_cpp project affecting GC-VM integration

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY - unified interfaces for component integration
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure) - will be determined in plan phase
- üë• Written for development team stakeholders managing technical debt

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a lua_cpp developer, I need unified and consistent type definitions across all modules so that I can integrate components (like GC with VM) without type conflicts or compilation errors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** multiple modules define similar types, **When** they are integrated, **Then** no type definition conflicts occur
2. **Given** a unified type system exists, **When** new modules are added, **Then** they can seamlessly use the shared type definitions
3. **Given** refactored interfaces, **When** existing tests are run, **Then** all tests continue to pass with no behavior changes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a module needs module-specific type variants?
- How does the system handle backward compatibility with existing contract tests?
- How are type conversions handled between different component boundaries?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single source of truth for core type definitions (LuaType, OpCode, ErrorType, RegisterIndex)
- **FR-002**: System MUST eliminate duplicate type definitions across modules
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain existing API contract compatibility  
- **FR-004**: System MUST support seamless component integration (GC, VM, Parser, etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all existing behavioral contracts from lua_c_analysis

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Interface changes must not break existing contract tests
- **NFR-002**: Type system must support compile-time type safety
- **NFR-003**: Interface unification must not impact runtime performance
- **NFR-004**: Changes must maintain lua_c_analysis behavioral compatibility
- **NFR-005**: Code must follow lua_with_cpp architectural patterns

### Key Entities
- **CoreTypes**: Unified definitions for LuaType, OpCode, ErrorType, RegisterIndex
- **ModuleInterfaces**: Standardized interfaces for GC, VM, Parser, Compiler components
- **TypeConverters**: Safe conversion utilities between component boundaries
- **ContractValidators**: Ensure interface changes maintain existing contracts

### Reference Project Integration
- **üîç lua_c_analysis verification**: All unified types must maintain exact behavioral compatibility with corresponding C types
- **üèóÔ∏è lua_with_cpp reference**: Interface design must follow existing modular architecture patterns
